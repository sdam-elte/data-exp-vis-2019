GITHUB REST API exercise
http://github.com/

Create an account first

1. You need to create a token first at github 
> Goto Settings / Developer settings 
Copy the token! Tokens can be regenerated later if forgotten

2. Test whether it works. We will use the created token for authentication. Using the right url it will associate our token with right user account
> https://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication
This is a GET method. curl's default method is GET 

curl -H "Authorization: token  yourtoken" https://api.github.com/user


3. Create a new repository
> https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#create
The data parameter needs to contain "auto_init": true
in order to initiate the repository and be able to add/commit files later on. It alse creates a Readme.md 
Your curl call is going to use the POST method ( -X POST) and will have data (-d or --data )
e.g.: curl -X POST  -H "Authorization: token  yourtoken" URL -d '{"key1":"valu1, "key2", "value2"}'


4. Modify 'homepage' and 'description' fields for the repository
> https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#edit
All repositories will use a safename, which is the given name in the previous call with lowercase letters and spaces replaced by dashes.



5. Create a file (commit)
> https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/#create-a-file
The content should be encoded in base64
cat "content of something" | base64 
or
base64 afile


6. Use previous output: find tree sha list that tree
> https://developer.github.com/v3/git/trees/#get-a-tree


7. #Create another file, which we will delete soon
> https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/#create-a-file


8. #Delete file
> https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/#delete-a-file
For deleting a file we will need it's sha code


9. Add us as a collaborator
> https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/collaborators/#add-user-as-a-collaborator
Add either "jegesm" or "dobos" or both users to your repository
