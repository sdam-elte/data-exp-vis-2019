### Statistics of water data

In this excercise we will select a few natural rivers and retrieve their data via a REST service. For data retrieval we use either curl from command line or pycurl from the notebook.

#### What is curl
"cURL is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the supported protocols (DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP). The command is designed to work without user interaction."

### USGS water data are available at https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis
Please visit this site and explore it.

There is a tutorial notebook to show the basic tools and their functionalities. To complete the tasks in the worksheet.ipynb you might need to use other tools or packages and there might be multiple good solutions.
