# Course description

The *Data exploration and visualization* course consists of several tutorials and excercise as an introductution into various data retrieval, exploration and visualization techniques. 
There are many databases, which are either publicly available or have limited access and use different services to deal with user queries. One commonly used method is when users can communicate via SQL queries. This is more efficient in case of larger dataqueries, when download time depends on the query script. Other method is to run a REST service that translates user queries to the database. This is easier to use and has it's own advantages.
The retrieved raw data is almost never as clean as we want it to be. It can have unexpected values due to measurement failure or for other reasons. In fact on average 50% effort of data exploration goes into understanding data and its cleaning.

Once data is digested one faces with many options in visualization, which all have their pros and cons. 
In this course we intend to introduce state of the art tools and methods in data exploration and visualization. This field evolves rapidly, like Jupyter notebooks didn't exist some years ago, but some of the programming languages and platforms proved efficient and/or easy to use and became widely used.

We will cover various packages in python and use SQL topics during this course. 
Each of the assignments will be a combination of these tools. 

The course is held in the North Building in computer lab 5.56 on fridays between 11:15 and 14:00.
There is a one hour lecture followed by a break and two hour laboratory work. Each occasion starts with an introduction to the current topic, like a hands-on session with the prepared notebooks, and then the remaining time is consultation, when lecturers will be available to help with the assignments. 

The schedule is the following:
1.  02.15. [USGS water discharge statistics](USGS-waterdata-curl-pandas) - pandas, REST query with curl - due 21.03.2019 
2.  02.22. [SQL queries on an NBA database](Basketball_League-SQL) - SQL part I 
3.  03.01. [SQL queries on an NBA database](Basketball_League-SQL) - SQL part II - due 28.03.2019 
4.  03.08. [Network exploration](Networkx) - networkx
5.  03.22. [Natural Language Processing on tweets](NLP_on_tweets)
6.  03.29. [REST services](REST-services) - Github, jupyter-kernelgateway
7.  04.05. [Visualization](Interactive_Visualization) - bokeh, holoviews, interactive reports
8.  04.12. Astrophysics
9.  04.26. [Following Jon Snow](Jon_Snow-geopandas-folium-shapely) - geopandas, shapely, folium
10. 05.03. [3D Visualization]( 	3d_Visualization)
11. 05.17. Consultation

### Where to work on the assignments?
https://kooplex-edu.elte.hu/hub is where the notebooks will be handed out. It is available for all students and once you run your notebook server you will find a folder with the course material. The notebooks will be available in this Github repository as well.
We will explain how to use this portal on the first lecture.
You can access this portal from outside the university as well e.g. from home. In case there is any problem with the portal you can run a notebook server locally on the lab computers and upload your work later.

### Learning materials
* Python tutorial: http://bokae.web.elte.hu/numerical_methods.html (translated from the BSc course "numerical methods in physics I" by Eszter Bok√°nyi, work in progress )
* SQL tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/ 
* RESTful service: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer
* 

### Requirements and grading
There will be an assignment for ech of the 9 topics, which need to be completed individually. The deadlines for the submissions are shown next to the topic and all related information will be in the topics' folder. There are no strict deadlines, however we advise students to keep them in order to be able to complete all tasks.
